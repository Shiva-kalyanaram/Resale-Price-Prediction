# Rental Price Prediction Project

## Overview

In the real estate industry, predicting accurate rental prices is crucial for property owners, tenants, and management companies. This project aims to develop a data-driven model for predicting residential rental prices based on relevant features.

## Project Summary

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Explored and analyzed the dataset.
- Addressed missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering.

### Model Development

- Implemented a LightGBM (Gradient Boosting) model for its efficiency.
- Trained the model on diverse features, including property type, location, amenities, and spatial coordinates.

### Evaluation Metrics

- Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for performance evaluation.
- Achieved commendable accuracy with LightGBM, as evidenced by acceptable MAE and MSE scores.

### Visualization

- Created visualizations illustrating the correlation between predicted and actual rental prices.

### Findings

- Identified the significance of features like location and property type in influencing rental prices.
- Successfully captured complex relationships within the data.

### Challenges and Future Work

- Encountered challenges in dealing with missing data and feature selection.
- Future work may involve collecting additional data for enhanced model robustness.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and/or Seaborn for creating visualizations.
- **LightGBM:** Chosen as the machine learning model for its efficiency and strong predictive capabilities.
- **Deployment:** The model was deployed on the Render cloud platform.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our machine learning rental price detection model proves to be a valuable tool for estimating property rental prices. The project contributes to the broader field of real estate analytics, offering practical applications for both tenants seeking fair rental prices and property owners optimizing their rental strategies.
